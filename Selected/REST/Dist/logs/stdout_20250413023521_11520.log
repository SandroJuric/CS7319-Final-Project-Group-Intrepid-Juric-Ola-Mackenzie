A fatal error was encountered. The library 'hostpolicy.dll' required to execute the application was not found in 'C:\Program Files\dotnet'.
Failed to run as a self-contained app.
  - The application was run as a self-contained app because 'C:\Users\Owner\Documents\SA_Projects\CS7319_Project\7319\REST\Dist\InstantMessaging.runtimeconfig.json' did not specify a framework.
  - If this should be a framework-dependent app, specify the appropriate framework in 'C:\Users\Owner\Documents\SA_Projects\CS7319_Project\7319\REST\Dist\InstantMessaging.runtimeconfig.json'.
